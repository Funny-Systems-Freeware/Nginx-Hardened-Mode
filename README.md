## Features
### Drop Requests from Untrusted Source Address
ã€€If a request comes from an address out of trusted list, it'll be drop immediately.

### Get Latest IPs List of Trusted Service Automatically
ã€€Make it easier to deal with ips lists provided by numerous well-known services which changed frequently. Currently supported: cloudflare, fastly.

### Immediately Error Reporting
ã€€Auto reporting while failed over to Normal Mode (Behavior of Original Nginx) by WebHook.
 
 ## Roadmap
 + âœ… Source IP address validation
 + âœ… IP List of CDN (ex: cloudflare, fastly...etc)
 + ðŸš€ IP List of Public Cloud (ex: gcp, azure, aws, akamai... etc)
 + ðŸš€ðŸš€ Secret Sauce :)

## Known Issues
+ Commands `nginx -s reload` and `nginx -s stop` might fail in certain conditions. If encounter such error, you might have to kill nginx processes manually.
+ Binary compatibility (ex: Nginx MODULE SIGNATURE)
